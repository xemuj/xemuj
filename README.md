## Technical Experience

**SIRA (Sistema Integrado de Registro de Albergues)**
The Fuego Volcano erupted on 3 June 2018 displacing over 4,700 people from their communities of origin. Many people also lost their lives during the natural disaster. As part of a coordinated response to a Government request, I as part of the IOMÂ´s information team for the Northern Triangle of Central America developed a first version of the Integrated Shelter Registry System (SIRA) to facilitate collective site management in terms of identification of affected population, family reunification, missing persons reporting, protection for vulnerable population, citizen security at shelters and general information.

The SIRA became the official tool for the Government of Guatemala to register population in shelters and continues to be used today for reconstruction and recovery processes. However, during the initial response to the crisis, there were several lessons learned that could have saved more lives, prevent mismanagement of NFIs donated by the private sector and diaspora, as well as improved health for IDPs and inventory management at collective sites by expanding the system and making its installation easier and faster. Additionally, during the current recovery phase, many government institutions have had problems identifying and delivering cash transfer programs to the people in need due to on-the-field conditions as well as response times (paperwork) and the location of Governmental offices.
