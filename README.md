## Technical Experience

**SIRA (Integrated Shelter Registration System)**
The Fuego Volcano erupted on June 3, 2018, displacing over 4,700 people from their communities. Many people also lost their lives during the natural disaster. As part of a coordinated response to a Government request, I developed the first version of the Integrated Shelter Registration System (SIRA) to facilitate collective site management in terms of identifying affected population, family reunification, missing persons reporting, protection for vulnerable population, citizen security at shelters, and general information.

SIRA became the official tool for the Government of Guatemala to register the population in shelters and continues to be used today for reconstruction and recovery processes. During the initial response to the crisis, several lessons were learned that could have saved more lives, prevented the mismanagement of NFIs donated by the private sector and diaspora, and improved health for IDPs and inventory management at collective sites.
- PHP
- MySQL
- JavaScript
- Google Auth
- EOS Blockchain (next version)

**SITLAM (Labor Migration Traceability System)**
Developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SITLAM monitors the transit of migrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector of Costa Rica. The system provides real-time identity documents, enabling migrant workers to maintain a regular migratory status and improving their access to rights and health services. SITLAM now has a legal framework in Costa Rica, reinforcing its implementation and scope in the country [source](https://kmhub.iom.int/en/good-practices/labour-migration-traceability-system-sitlam).
